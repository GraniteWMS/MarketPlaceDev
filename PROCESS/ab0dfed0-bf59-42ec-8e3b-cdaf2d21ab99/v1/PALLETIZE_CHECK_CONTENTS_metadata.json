    "Description":  "Used to enforce packing only a single MasterItem per pallet, up to a maximum count of TrackingEntities.\n\nThis process makes use of the PackageType field on the MasterItem table. It should contain the maximum number of TrackingEntities of this MasterItem allowed on a pallet.\n\nIf PackageType is left empty, or set to 0, users will be able to pack as many TrackingEntities of the MasterItem onto a pallet as they wish.",
