    "Description":  "If you need a system where users scan both the Location and MasterItem to identify the stock, thereby eliminating the need to print Tracking Entity barcodes. This process will use the barcode format of [LocationBarcode]_[MasterItemCode] to find the TrackingEntity.\n\nIf the TrackingEntity does not exist it is created using CLR_Takeon. If the barcode is not in the current session then it is added.",
