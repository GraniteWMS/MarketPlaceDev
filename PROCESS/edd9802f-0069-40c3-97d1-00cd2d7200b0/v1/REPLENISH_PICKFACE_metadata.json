    "Description":  "Intended for use where pickface locations do not contain physical TrackingEntity barcodes. When you replenish to a location that already contains the MasterItem being replenished, it will add to the existing TrackingEntity. If the MasterItem does not yet exist in the pickface location, a new TrackingEntity will be created.\n\nPickface locations must have type PICKFACE assigned.",
